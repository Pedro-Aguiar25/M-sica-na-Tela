                <p>
                    For this week's In Conversation we sat down with Shawn Mendes to talk personal happiness over
                    external achievements, challenges of fame, mental health, and self-discovery in the public eye.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shawn Mendes is renegotiating his relationship with fame and success. Though he’s only 26, the
                    Canadian singer-songwriter has been famous for more than a decade – he first came to prominence in
                    2013 on Vine, a video-sharing platform that doesn’t even exist any more. Since then, he’s built a
                    career that’s staggeringly successful by any metric.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each of his four previous studio albums entered the Billboard 200 at Number One, while four of his
                    singles have amassed more than two billion Spotify streams apiece. One of these, 2019’s ‘Señorita’,
                    is a sultry Latin pop duet with his then-partner Camilla Cabello (they split in 2021, but remain
                    close friends). But the others – 2015’s ‘Stitches’, 2016’s ‘Treat You Better’ and 2017’s ‘There’s
                    Nothing Holdin’ Me Back’ – are more typical of Mendes’ peppy, guitar-led style. Pop-rock king John
                    Mayer has always been one of his biggest influences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Becoming mega-famous as a teenager hasn’t come without its challenges. In 2021, Mendes was seven
                    shows into his ‘Wonder’ world tour when he announced he was cancelling the remaining 80 dates to
                    focus on his mental health. “After speaking with my team and working with an incredible group of
                    health professionals, it has become more clear that I need to take the time I’ve never taken
                    personally, to ground myself and come back stronger,” he said at the time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mendes has also faced a constant swirl of cruel and unnecessary speculation about his sexuality. He
                    addressed this on stage in Red Rocks, Colorado, at the end of October when he told fans: “The real
                    truth about my life and my sexuality is that man, I’m just figuring it out like everyone. And it
                    feels really scary because we live in a society that has a lot to say about that. I’m trying to be
                    really brave and just allow myself to be a human and feel things. And that’s all I really want to
                    say about that for now.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When NME meets Mendes in London a couple of months before this cathartic moment, he is still getting
                    used to being public-facing again. “It feels a lot, and also it feels different,” he says of being
                    back in pop star mode. “I think this time around, just the music itself asks for an entirely
                    different environment and energy. Even just walking into the room with all of you here after [my
                    gig] last night, I think you guys just have a different energy around me because of the music. So
                    that’s cool. I like that.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    The day before this interview, he performed every track from his intimate, folk-leaning new album
                    ‘Shawn’, which is out today (November 15), at London’s Theatre Royal Drury Lane. The stage was
                    softened with candles and vintage rugs as a relaxed-looking Mendes sang, smiled and shared stories.
                    He also played the harmonium, an organ-like instrument that he mastered by learning traditional
                    Kirtan songs, which signify devotion in several Indian religions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Before he started work on ‘Shawn’, this act of playing an instrument for the pure joy of it helped
                    Mendes to reconnect with his creativity. “I wasn’t sitting at a piano making a pop song, I was
                    singing something [that’s] 10,000-plus years old and it just completely took me out of my own head,”
                    he says.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While writing ‘Shawn’, Mendes was inspired by classic singer-songwriters including Joni Mitchell,
                    Bob Dylan and James Taylor. Fittingly, the album ends with a heartfelt rendition of ‘Hallelujah’ by
                    Leonard Cohen, one of Canada’s most influential musicians. “I posted covers of [that song] online on
                    YouTube when I was, like, 15 or 16 and actually never really paid attention to the lyrics, because I
                    never really could grasp the concept of what he was reckoning with, which was the idea of God and
                    spirit,” Mendes explains. “And at 26 after going through my own kind of relationship with that,
                    those lyrics just felt so resonant and it just felt like the right time to [record it].”
                </p>

                <p>
                    In a candid In Conversation interview, Mendes discusses writing his new album from “a place of
                    authenticity”, the prospect of embarking on another arena tour, and how he measures success at this
                    point in his career.

                    <b>At the gig, you spoke about ‘The Mountain’ being a very important song from your new album.
                        What’s
                        the story behind it?</b>
                </p>

                <p>
                    “Maybe it’s not for everyone, but for me, I have quite an existential place I like to go to
                    sometimes. I just had a ton of questions about a lot of different things. And I think it was really
                    just a moment for me to tell my side of the story and to just claim myself. Usually, I don’t really
                    care what people write about in articles and stuff, but there was a couple that I was just like,
                    ‘This is bullshit. I need to write a song just to kind of…’
                </p>

                <p>
                    “It was empowering for me because the end line of every [musical] phrase is, like, ‘So call it what
                    you want. You can say that I’m this and say that I’m that, but I know what I am.’ And that was an
                    empowering phrase for me to get to.”

                <p>
                    <b>On the song’s final pre-chorus, you sing: “You can say I’m too young / You can say I’m too old /
                        You
                        can say I like girls or boys / Whatеver fits your mould.” Was it empowering to sing those words
                        in
                        what feels like quite a playful, nonchalant way?</b>
                </p>

                <p>
                    “Exactly, exactly. There’s so much pressure on us to know everything, and us to be so clear on
                    everything. And also, I know exactly what I am, and also I have no idea. I’m figuring that out just
                    like everyone else. So it’s just kind of a hilarious concept in general, for people to be like,
                    ‘This is what I am.’ It’s restrictive. Then you don’t let yourself become something better than you
                    could have ever imagined. Maybe.”

                <p>
                    <b>Everyone’s trying to figure themselves out in their twenties, but few of us have to do that with
                        the glare that you have on you.</b>
                </p>

                <p>
                    “I appreciate you saying that – I agree. And yeah, I was talking about this with a friend last
                    night, actually. You know, the pressure of discovering yourself in the public eye can be really
                    annoying and frustrating. Or it can be an opportunity to do it in a way that hopefully inspires
                    other people to be OK with being confused about things.”

                <p>
                    “Yeah, it really depends on the day. Because I’ve gone through swings where I’ve just deleted social
                    media and pretended that no one can see me, and that wasn’t right. And then I’ve gone through places
                    where all I can think about is what people think [and] how they see me, and that wasn’t right
                    [either]. So yeah, it’s a constant relationship, like anything.”

                    that the world deems successful. I’m tired of that because that perception being the most important
                    thing led me to the most depressed and exhausted I ever was in my life. And I’m not even saying this
                    in a jaded way – I hope I don’t sound jaded.

                    it and [for] it to do well at the sacrifice of my happiness and my sense of self. So that’s kind of

                    acoustic guitar, and things felt much more connected. And then as things got bigger and bigger, I
                    just felt physically further from people, but also emotionally further. I felt like, ‘Oh, so I’m on
                    this pedestal or something,’ And I don’t know why, but I felt far and distant. And John Mayer said
                    this great thing in an interview. He said his dream is to have the stage be level with the crowd.
                    You know, obviously the stage is never going to be [physically] level. But metaphorically, I thought
                    that made so much sense.”

                    it’d be so much energy and so fun. And I’m not going to allow my fear of the past to control the
                    future in that sense. So if that urge starts to come back, I’m not going to fight it. So yeah, I’ll

                    please anyone. I was just being honest,’ that’s an extremely successful thing. Because I think it’s
                    tough to do that as a human.

                <p>
                    “I don’t claim to do that all the time. I think we’re always constantly sensitive and aware of
                    everyone, and trying to please and all that. So success for me is just like, was that authentic? And
                    after that, did people enjoy it? And then after that, all the other things. A dream of mine would be
                    to be completely authentic, and for it to be a Number One song, and for there to be crowds of
                    hundreds of thousands of people. That’s the dream, and I’m gonna hold on to that.”

                    participações ecléticas acaba por criar uma sensação de desconexão, tanto temática quanto sonora.
                    Sem um tema unificador, o álbum parece um mosaico onde o artista “tira tudo do seu sistema”, mas nem
                    sempre de maneira coesa. E, embora isso por si só não seja um problema, cria momentos onde o ouvinte
                    se encontra mais aguardando o próximo experimento do que imerso na construção emocional da faixa
                    atual.
