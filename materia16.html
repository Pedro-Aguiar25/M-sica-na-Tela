                    “Hello Kitty has a global community of devoted fans, and much like Fender, has transcended
                    generations, culture, and geography. This partnership speaks to the joy and creativity both brands
                    have inspired worldwide,” said Edward “Bud” Cole, President of Fender APAC.
                </p>

                <p>
                    “It’s about more than just a guitar – this is about giving players a platform to express their
                    individuality, with quality instruments, gear, clothing and collectibles that spark creativity,
                    wherever they are.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    The latest collection follows a host of guitar collaborations from the likes of Jack White,
                    Blink-182’s Tom DeLonge and Blu DeTiger.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Speaking about his signature guitars and amp with Fender, White recently said: “We found the best of
                    the old, with the best of the new and mixed innovation with the history of Fender to do something
                    that we think Leo Fender would have been very proud of if he was alive today.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    DeLonge also described his Fender signature Starcaster as “the coolest guitar ever made”.
                </p>

                <p>
                    He added: “I love this guitar, I really do. It’s the coolest guitar ever made. Firstly, it is called
                    a Starcaster – that’s the most important thing. It goes to space and expands your mind.”
